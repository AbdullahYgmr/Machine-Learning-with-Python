# Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains various machine learning projects aimed at exploring different aspects of machine learning, from basic algorithms to more advanced techniques. The projects demonstrate the practical implementation of machine learning models, data preprocessing, evaluation metrics, and optimization strategies.

## Projects in this repository

The repository includes projects such as:
- Supervised Learning Algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Trees, SVM)
- Unsupervised Learning (e.g., K-Means Clustering, PCA)
- Neural Networks and Deep Learning models (e.g., MLP, CNN)
- Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering techniques
- Model Evaluation and Hyperparameter Tuning

Each project focuses on solving a specific problem or applying a particular machine learning technique using real-world datasets.
